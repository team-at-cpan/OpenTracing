OpenTracing::SpanProxy - wrapper around an L<OpenTracing::Span>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the wrapper class that user code would normally receive when working
with spans. It allows the creation of nested subspans, and will automatically
mark the span as complete when the proxy object is discarded.

For methods available here, see L<OpenTracing::Span>.

=head2 span

Returns the L<OpenTracing::Span> instance that this wraps.

=head2 log

Writes a log entry to the L<OpenTracing::Span>.

=head2 new_span

Creates a new sub-span under this L<OpenTracing::Span> instance.

=head2 DESTROY

Called on destruction, will mark completion on the span by calling
L<OpenTracing::Span/finish>.
