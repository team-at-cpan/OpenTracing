=head1 NAME

OpenTracing - support for L<https://opentracing.io> application tracing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an early implementation, so the API may be subject to change.

In general, you'll want to create an L<OpenTracing::Batch>, then add one
or more L<OpenTracing::Span> instances to it. Those instances can have zero
or more L<OpenTracing::Log> entries.
