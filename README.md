# NAME

OpenTracing - support for [https://opentracing.io](https://opentracing.io) application tracing

# DESCRIPTION

This is an early implementation, so the API may be subject to change.

In general, you'll want to create an [OpenTracing::Batch](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenTracing::Batch), then add one
or more [OpenTracing::Span](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenTracing::Span) instances to it. Those instances can have zero
or more [OpenTracing::Log](https://metacpan.org/pod/OpenTracing::Log) entries.
